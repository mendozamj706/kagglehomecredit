## Summary of Business Problem and Project Objective

Our team embarked on a data-driven journey to address the complex challenge of predicting loan default rates for Home Credit, a financial institution. The objective of this project was to enhance Home Credit's lending practices by developing a predictive model that could accurately identify individuals likely to default on loans on top of the tradional credit history check. This problem is of paramount importance to the financial industry, as it impacts individuals who don't have sufficient history who are capable of availing a loan. We aimed to harness the power of data science and machine learning to mitigate credit risk and improve lending decisions, ultimately benefiting both Home Credit and its clients.

## Our Group's Solution to the Business Problem

To tackle the business problem, our group employed a two-pronged approach, comprising exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. The EDA notebook dives deep into the dataset, uncovering insights, visualizing trends, and understanding the underlying patterns. In the Modelling notebook, we developed and fine-tuned machine learning models to predict loan default probabilities. This comprehensive approach allowed us to build a predictive model that can assist Home Credit in making more informed lending decisions.

## Contribution, Business Value, Difficulties, and Lessons Learned

In this project, my primary contributions included data preprocessing, fine tuning models, and model evaluation. Our group successfully developed a predictive model with strong performance, enhancing Home Credit's ability to assess credit risk. Along the way, we encountered challenges related to imbalanced data, model interpretability, and feature selection, but we overcame these hurdles through collaboration and research. The business value of our solution lies in the potential to reduce default rates, minimize financial losses, and enhance Home Credit's overall portfolio performance. Throughout the project, I learned the importance of data quality, feature engineering, and the iterative nature of machine learning model development. Additionally, effective communication through our presentation was crucial in conveying our insights and findings to stakeholders.
